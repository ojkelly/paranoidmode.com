## Symmetric encryption

Also known as **[symmetric-key algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm)**, they are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext.

In comparison to asymmetric encryption, both parties require the same `shared key` in order to exchange encrypted messages.

## PGP


> Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a data encryption and decryption computer program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is often used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. It was created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991.

## Private Key

Your `private key` is your `public key` plus the `secret information` that you need to make the hard problem of decryption, into an easy problem.


## Public Key

Your `public key` is best thought of as a schematic for a lock. It describes precisely how to build the lock. This is a special lock, due to it's complexity knowing how to build it, and use the lock function, doesn't mean you know how to unlock it.

It is possible to unlock the lock through a process called factorization. But with traditional computers and when you're using large key sizes, it's technically not feasible.
