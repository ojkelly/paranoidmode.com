# Subkeys

Your sub-keys, like your root key pair, are a normal key pair (a paired public key and private key). Unlike your root key, they cannot `certify` other keys. That capability is reserved exclusively for the root keypair.

Sub-keys are mostly ephemeral. You will replace them every year.

You should never have a copy of the private key of a sub-key, rather it should be generated and stored solely on **one** smart card. If the smart-card is lost, stolen or fails, you can revoke the sub-keys (using your root key pair), replace the smart card, and generate new sub-keys &mdash; **in that order**.

## How they work

Using your root keypair you ask a smart card to generate new keys and send the public key back. The public key is then signed with your root key pair. You do this for each subkey typically 3, one each for `encryption`, `signing`, and `authentication`. Then you publish your updated root key-pair with the signatures for your new subkeys.

Now you have 3 key pairs cryptographically guaranteed to be under your control, (as we signed them with your root key pair).

## Why we use them

They're much easier to use than using your root key pair all the time. If you didn't have sub-keys every time you wanted to use your root key pair you would need:
 - to boot your secure air-gapped computer
 - transfer the information to be encrypted
 - unlock your private key
 - decrypt or sign the information
 - destroy the private key on the computer
 - transfer the information back to your normal computer

Why so many steps? Why can't you just keep the whole key pair on your computer?

Keeping the key pair on your computer is actually common place for `ssh`, but it shouldn't be. It's trivial to ex-filtrate keys, aside from all looking the same, they're almost always in the same place `~/.ssh`.

With sub-keys, you have a USB device that physically stores the private key component of your sub key. You need to maintain physical control of the smart card, but that is exponentially easier than maintaining control of a key pair sitting on a computer.

Futher, by storing your sub-keys on a smart-card the private keys are never published. A good smart-card makes it technically impossible to extract the private keys. That's not to say there may not be a way, the goal is to make it prohibitively dangerous and expensive.

Smart-cards also have very low pin failure limits. If you guess your pin wrong 3 times, and then guess your admin pin (PUK) wrong 3 times, the card will erase itself.

If that happens you will forever lose access to those sub-keys, and you will need your root key to generate new ones.
