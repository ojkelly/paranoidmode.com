# Generate your root PGP key

## **What you will need**

Before you get started you will need to get the following:

 - **1-2 hours** (I think)
 - `Dice`
   - Ideally you want 8, but 1 will do
 - `GPG Tools`
   - [Download GPG Tools](https://www.gpgtools.org/)
 - **1** `Tails.iso`
   - [Download Tails](https://tails.boum.org/)
 - **3** brand new `USB drives`.
   - 1 for our Tails installation called `TAILS`,
   - 1 to store your `private key` and `revocation certificate` called `PRIVATE`,
   - 1 to transfer your `public key` your normal computer called `PUBLIC`,
 - **1 Yubikey 4** or newer, or similar `OpenPGP Smart Card`
   - I'm using a Yubikey because they're small, well built, and easy
   - The Yubikey 4 allows for 4096 bit keys, previous Yubikey's do not allow keys this big, and some older
      Yubikeys don't support `OpenPGP Smart Card`. Make it easy for yourself, get a new Yubikey 4 or newer.
 - **1** `air-gapped laptop`
   - Ideally this is a laptop with the following removed or not installed: `microphone`, `speakers`,
   `webcam/camera`, `wifi antenna`, `bluetooth antenna`, `3G/4G/5G/6G/7G antenna`, `hard drives`, and any other devices capable of transmitting information wirelessly.
   - It is possible to use your normal computer and boot Tails on it, but I wouldn't recommend it. Best to be paranoid here.
 - **1** `everyday computer`
   - This is the one you normally use, and will use day to day
 - **1** `non-wireless printer`
   - You'll need one that works with Tails, check to see if there are Linux drivers available,
   - You can technically use a wireless capable printer, but as we are going to use this to print out a backup,
    of your `private key`, using a wireless capable, or internet connected computer adds significant risk that your `private key` will be exfiltrated and rendered insecure.
 - A safe place to store a backup of your private key, common locations are:
   - a `safe` (the metal kind with a code),
   - your parents house, or the house of someone you trust
   - any location where you can be sure you will know if it has been accessed

You might also want to get some tamper evident bags to store your `private key` backups inside of. I'll leave this up to you.

## **What you will have after this**

Once you've completed this guide, you will have the following:

  - 1 `diceware` passphrase
    - likely written down and in your wallet. Burn when you can remember it.
  - 1 USB with the following stored on it:
    - your `private key` which is only capable of `certification`
    - a `revocation certificate` for your `public key`
    - **This USB is never allowed to be connected to a computer that is connected to a network. It should only ever connect to an air-gapped Tails computer**
  - 1 USB with the following stored on it:
    - your `public key`
  - 1 Yubikey (or other OpenPGP Card) with the following stored on it:
    - 1 `subkey` for `encryption`
    - 1 `subkey` for `signing`
    - 1 `subkey` for `authentication`
  - 1 `paperkey` a printed out backup of the secret parts of your `private key` that is to be used if the USB with your `private key` stops working.
  - Your public key will be distributed to the public key servers
  - Keybase currently has a bug preventing it from working with Yubikeys, so this is not yet covered - Jan 2016
